# Chronos Management Backend

Welcome to **Chronos**, a luxury Swiss watch store.  
Except the management system isnâ€™t very luxurious. In fact, it doesnâ€™t exist. This is not good.  

Your job: build a **custom management backend** (think Shopify, but bespoke) so Chronos can manage orders, customers, products, and more.

## ðŸ“¦ What Youâ€™re Given

- **Products** â†’ `./data/products.json`  
- **Customers** â†’ `./data/customers.json`  

Thatâ€™s it. The rest is up to you. It is highly reccommend you make new data to work with.

## ðŸŽ¯ Core Requirement

- **For You Engine**  
  - Implement the `/for-you` endpoint to recommend the top 4 products for a given customer.  
  - The frontend passes a simulated user ID (stored in `localStorage`).  
  - Bonus: let admins adjust the recommendation logic in the dashboard.
